Launch this project with docker-compose up -d --build, and access it at localhost:81.

You will first need to create an account in the Login Page before you can use any feature.

Once that is done, you should add some movies you have seen to your account at the page designed for that.

Several mock accounts already exist on the database, they are not to be connected with but you can use them to test the recommendation engine as they have their share of seen movies and favorite genres.

To use the recommendation engine :
- go to the Engine page
- enter the emails of the accounts you want to participate in the recommendation program
- once you have every wanted email selected, proceed to the "envoyer" button.
A list of films graded on several factors such as genre, duration, release date should appear.
